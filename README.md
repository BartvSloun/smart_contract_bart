To boot the environment in your browser: 

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/JensScheel/web-ide/tree/main)


In the repo there are two contracts provided. 
The [petition contact](https://gitlab.com/partisiablockchain/language/example-contracts/-/tree/main/petition?ref_type=heads)
and the [average salary contract](https://gitlab.com/partisiablockchain/language/example-contracts/-/tree/main/zk-average-salary?ref_type=heads)
in a dev-container, where all the tooling for developing smart contracts for the Partisia Blockchain are installed.

## Use for own contract development

To use the environment to develop your own contracts, fork the repository. Now you can change the
contract code and save those changes. 

For local development see the [dev container documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

## Setup
To interact with the Partisia Blockchain there are provided three new keys, A.pk, B.pk and C.pk.
The keys have been filled with 100.000.000 gas on the Testnet, as a part of the environment boot-up.
